                <h2>IRON MAN OF INDIA</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</b>, the iron man of India, was born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, 
                    Kheda district of Gujarat. He was a successful barrister, a Senior Congress leader and one of the prominent figures of India’s freedom struggle movement.
                     A staunch congressman, the first deputy Prime Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai was a true Gandhian who was committed to the unity and integrity of India.
                     He played an exemplary role in the integration of 565 princely states to the union of India and was proudly regarded as the Iron Man of India. Recently, Sardar Patel, 
                     in a very calculated and fabricated manner, was projected to be anti-Nehru and a seamless campaign was unleashed to project Pt. Nehru as his adversary. 
                     But the history says otherwise, both Pt. Nehru and Sardar Patel were the right and the left hands of the Congress Party and their commitment to democracy,
                     secularism and integrity of the country was unparalleled. In the current situation when the ‘idea of India’ is under fierce attack and a charged communal environment is hovering over the country;
                     imposing threat to the integrity of the country. The farmers have been protesting the three contentious farm laws and the government is least bothered to talk to them; let alone solving the problems of the farmers. 
                     The life and principles of Sarder Patel become pertinent in this environment of hatred and insensitivity against which he stood firmly and vehemently throughout his life.
                     After completing his education in England, he returned to India and settled in Ahmedabad and became one of the city’s most successful barristers.
                     He was not keen to join add politics at the early stages of his life but his meeting with Mahatma Gandhi in 1917 in Godhra changed his life fundamentally.
